    "## 1 - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes algorithm stands as a cornerstone in Machine Learning and Data Science, leveraging Bayes' Theorem with the goal of determining whether a data point belongs to a specific class. The algorithm makes a \"naive assumption\" that each feature is independent of the others. This assumption almost certainly isn't true of your data, but making it leads to a significantly easier algorithm to implement, and as you'll see can lead to impressively useful results. It's important to note that Naive Bayes is a supervised algorithm, meaning it requires data that's already labeled to function effectively. In the example you're about to see, that means it requires that a collection of emails have already been marked as \"spam\" or \"ham\" in order to train the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes for Spam Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment focuses on a binary classification problem: distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails, colloquially referred to as \"ham.\" For the purpose of this task, spam emails will be labeled as $1$, and non-spam (ham) emails as $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of interest for a given email is denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{spam} \\mid \\text{email}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher this probability, the more likely the email is to be classified as spam. Bayes' Theorem, which you saw in the lectures, is used in the calculation in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{spam} \\mid \\text{email}) = \\frac{P(\\text{email} \\mid \\text{spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{spam})}{P(\\text{email})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ P(\\text{spam}) $: Probability of a randomly selected email being spam, equivalent to the proportion of spam emails in the dataset.\n",
    "- $ P(\\text{email} \\mid \\text{spam}) $: Probability of a specific email occurring given that it is known to be spam.\n",
    "- $ P(\\text{email}) $: Overall probability of the email occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting early \"shortcut\" you can take in this approach is just ignore the $ P(\\text{email}) $ term. The goal of this calculation will be to compare the probability an email is spam to the probability is ham. Here's the expression for both $ P(\\text{spam} \\mid \\text{email}) $ and $ P(\\text{ham} \\mid \\text{email}) $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{spam} \\mid \\text{email}) = \\frac{P(\\text{email} \\mid \\text{spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{spam})}{P(\\text{email})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{ham} \\mid \\text{email}) = \\frac{P(\\text{email} \\mid \\text{ham}) \\cdot P(\\text{ham})}{P(\\text{email})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ P(\\text{email}) > 0 $ and it appears in both expressions, comparing the two probabilities only requires evaluating the numerators and you can ignore this denominator."

It is sufficient to compute only $P(\\text{spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{email} \\mid \\text{spam})$ and $P(\\text{ham}) \\cdot P(\\text{email} \\mid \\text{ham})$ to make the comparison.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both cases work identically, so let's start on the spam case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each email is a list of words. Your goal is to calculate how likely you are to see this list of words, given the email is spam. The way you'll do that is to apply the product rule.

    "This is where you make the **naive assumption** that leads to the name \"Naive Bayes\"! You will assume that each word's probability of appearing in an email is independent of each other word's probability. This assumption, of course, is false. Emails that contain the word \"party\" are probably more likely to include the word \"invitation\". Emails that contain the word \"prize\" are probably more likely to include the word \"congratulations\". By making a false assumption that these probabilities are independent, however, you gain the ability to apply the product rule. Rather than accounting for a complex set of conditional probabilities between words, you can simply assume independence and multiply a fairly simple set of conditional probabilities as shown in the expression above. Naive Bayes is built on an inaccurate assumption about your data, but as you'll see, it often yields impressive results!\n",

With this in mind, **your first task will be to create a dictionary named `word_frequency` to store the frequency with with every word in the dataset appears in ham and spam emails**\n",

    "Encountering a word that only appears in spam emails or never appears in a spam email may result in $P(\\text{word} \\mid \\text{spam}) = 0$ (or the ham analog), leading to the entire product being $0$. This scenario is undesirable as a single word could make the entire probability $0$. To mitigate this, you will **start by counting spam/ham appearances for every word from 1**. By artificially assuming that there is at least one spam and one ham email with every word, you eliminate the possibility of $0$ appearing in the computations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section you will explore the performance of the model you've just built. Recall you trained you model on 80% of the data, and randomly preserved 20% of your data as test data to test it. The natural question then, is how often the model makes a correct classification when used on your test data. To answer this question, there exists one metric called [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision). This is a measure of how much the model predicts correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the accuracy, you must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count every spam email that the model correctly classifies as spam (these are called **true positives**)\n",
    "- Count every ham email that the model correctly classifies as ham (these are called **true negatives**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to get a proportion, you divide the sum of the true positives and true negatives by the total number of observations. If the model is perfect, then the accuracy would be 1, or 100%. The next code block will implement functions to make this calculation."

billion power project  at dabhol , the veto exercised by the company chairman kenneth lay has saved  the project \u0001 * - at least for the timebeing . sources said the meeting held on  tuesday at the energy major ' s headquarters in houston could have sounded the  death knell for the only big foreign investment in the indian power sector .  although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lenders  unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not  honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled , the veto exercised at  this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost  to the indian venture . company sources said : \" we do not know what went on  there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out . \" with the  engineering procurement and construction contractors ge and equipment  suppliers bechtel too in a cautious mode mode , dpc was finding it even more  difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules .  sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board would  be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its  shareholders if the project actually flopped . enron had similar bitter  experiences in pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then  justify such investments to the shareholders .  enron , which had planned a major investments in india ' s infrastructure  sectors such as oil and gas , lng , gas transportation , telecom and broadband  network , has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these  operations . the company ' s mous with various other majors like indian oil  corporation , too , is in a limbo and the us major ' s stake in the oil and gas  venture is up for grabs . however , even though lay is still hoping to find a  solution to the controversy back home , both dpc and mseb are still to get  down to negotiations .  -

owned national  thermal power corporation ( ntpc ) to buy the excess capacity of dpc ' s total  2 , 184 mw project . \" let ntpc and power trading corporation of india ( ptc ) come  together and sell dpc ' s surlpus power . we have already mooted this  suggestion , but a favourable reply is yet to come from the union power  ministry , \" the official said . the official said that the centre , which was  also responsible for dpc project as it has provided counter guarantee to  enron india , should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess  power to other states . the state government ' s reaction comes in wake of union  power minister suresh prabhu ' s discussion with chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh in delhi few days ago . it was learnt that prabhu told deshmukh  \" there is no question of ntpc buying power from the project since long term  ppas have been signed by ntpc with the buying states \" .  deshmukh had suggested that the central power utility should sell excess  power over and above the 300 - 400 mw needed for the state from the dpc ' s 740  mw phase - i and soon to be commissioned phase - ii of 1 , 444 mw , to other needy  states . considering the high cost of power generated from dpc , which during  the recent months has hovered around rs 7 per unit as against an average cost  of rs 2 . 30 - 2 . 80 a unit from central and state utilities , there would be few  takers for the power from dabhol , the power minister reportedly said .  \" deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought  down , \" he said , adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power  to the buyers .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , monday , 7 may 2001  reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties  arijit de , s ravindran & renni abraham in mumbai  in an unusual departure from normal practice , the maharashtra government has  allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its 447 - mw patalganga  power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) does not lift power . the project \u0001 , s power purchase  agreement ( ppa ) has a clause to this effect . the state government \u0001 , s  permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the  context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power  company \u0001 , s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third  parties .  dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company \u0001 , s  application had been pending with the chief minister \u0001 , s office for months .  only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to  negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state . the dpc project  is facing the threat of closure following mseb \u0001 , s inability to buy power from  it , thanks to the board \u0001 , s weak financial position . not only can the  reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra , but it can  sell power to utilities outside the state . the ppa does not expressly bar it  from doing so . nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power  can be sold . so , in effect , this suggests that the group could sell power to  industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to  the mseb . the state electricity board derives over 80 per cent of its revenue  from such consumers .  apart from captive power plants , independent power producers in india are  allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards . they can sell power  outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status . with  its 447 - mw capacity , the patalganga project is not eligible for such status  because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of 1 , 000  mw . speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week , reliance  industries managing director anil ambani told business standard : a provision  in third parties . ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb \u0001 , s weak  financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised  in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would  derail the patalganga project .  the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside  the state , a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response  to questions . a senior mseb official explained that the state government  cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the  unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former  mseb official . subsequently , it was realised that the state would be stuck  with excess power . so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third  parties , he said . the patalganga project along with the ispat group \u0001 , s 1 , 082  mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits  its second  report .  -

delayed reliance  industries - promoted patalganga and ispat industries ' bhadravati power  projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the  government that \" there is no need of these projects nor their power \" . the  loss - making board has communicated to the government that mseb had \" no  interest \" in patalganga and bhadravati , as it did not have escrow - able  capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  tremendously in maharashtra , state government sources said here on sunday .  \" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and  unaffordable , \" sources said . \" reliance ' s project is no different from that of  dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .  after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based  power plant in the state , \" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw  patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , \" as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances \" . when contacted , mseb chairman  vinay bansal said : \" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee ' s recommendations \" , but expressed inability to give  further details .  currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra . \" can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover ? \" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .  sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a \" guaranteed payment \" mechanism from  mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc . \" all the three were cleared  as ' fast - track ' projects , but other than enron , reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire , especially bhadravati , which has been hanging afire  since last nine years , \" they added .  moreover , the mseb official opined that given the current situation , if dpc  calls it quits from india , bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance ' s  patalganga . patalganga ' s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc ' s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4 . 50 per unit to as high as rs  7 , while bhadravati ' s cost could be around rs 3 . 80 to rs 4 per unit , he  informed . mseb ' s installed capacity ended on march 31 , 2001 , wasl 4 , 000 mw and  it has generated 45 , 000 million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as 39 per cent .

guarantee and  have also set strict conditions for reconsidering the termination of the  power purchase agreement ( ppa ) between the dpc and the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) . in a related development , the dpc has sent a note  to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the turn  of events as they have prevented the dpc from serving the ppa termination  notice last month .  the lenders . in their turn , sent a statement -

week reprieve have passed . at the dpc board meeting in london on may  25 , the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination  notice and got three weeks \u0001 , time for themselves to convince the centre as  well as the maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the  controversial project . in a letter to finance secretary ajit kumar dated  april 30 , the global arrangers said the government must own up its  responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay . among the  stiff conditions , set by the arrangers , are the demand that the central  government ensure payment of all the pending bills of mseb for december  2000 , january 2001 , february 2001 and march 2001 which remain unpaid  without any protest or reservation by may 7 ( monday ) .  any payment previously made under \u0001 & protest \u0001 8 should be made free and clear of  such protest or any other reservation , and the center should ensure timely  payment of future bills by mseb , they said . meanwhile , sources said that the  finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the  dabhol projects in london stand on the issue . the lenders \u0001 , list of demands  also include asking mseb to take steps required under the existing  contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of  financial close of phase ii of the project by may 7 .  they have demanded that the union government and the maharashtra government  should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will  take any step to impede the operation of phase i or the construction and  operation of phase ii without due cause . the lenders have also asked them to  ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and  equipment required for the project by may 21 . csfb , anz export finance ,  citi , bank of america and abn amro are the global arrangers for both phase i  as well as phase ii of the project .  the state bank of india , which is also a global arranger for phase ii , did  not sign the letter . \" ten days have passed since the lenders bought three  weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of  the ppa . since then , nothing has moved at the material level barring mseb ' s  payment of the january bill to the tune of rs 134 crore under protest , \" said  a source among the global arrangers . come forward to meet its obligations  the lenders are planning to meet around mid - may in london and this time  they will be left with no choice but to give the go - ahead to the company to  terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the  issue , the source added . the lenders are , however , not ready to take the  blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company . the  white & case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of the  project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the  last option - - termination of ppa .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , saturday , 5 may , 2001  ge may pull out as dpc supplier , s ravindran in mumbai  after us -

In this case, the root cause is the **very large product** involved in Naive Bayes calculations. Fortunately, there is a solution to this issue.\n",

    "In this section you will use both Naive Bayes models (with and without log) you've defined above to solve a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must develop a good spam detection model to run in a specific email software. The dataset you worked with in this assignment is the email base you have from this software. You must build a method to effectively protect users from receiving spam, **but you must avoid sending ham emails to the spam folder** since it might cause a user to lose important emails. On the other hand, it is not that concerning letting pass a couple of spam emails to the inbox folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2.2 Accuracy and its limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, what is the actual performance of the model you've developed thus far? The accuracy metric you defined above has some limitations, specially in this spam detection problem. You have seen in the beginning of the notebook that the proportion of spam emails in the dataset is 23.88%. So, if you create a rule to send **every email directly to inbox folder** it would correctly classify 76.12% of every email! So this pointless rule has an accuracy of 76.12%. \n",
    "\n",
    "To try to properly answer this question, you can ask yourself two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many spam emails the algorithm correctly classifies as spam? They are called **true positives**.\n",
    "- How many **ham** emails the algorithm **mistakenly classifies** as spam? They are called **false positives**. **This is the important question you must look closer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question relates to a metric called [*recall*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall). To answer the first question, you must count how many spam emails there exist in the dataset and count how many of them are correctly labeled as spam by the model (true positives). This is defined as the recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{recall} = \\frac{\\text{true positives (spam emails correctly labeled as spam)}}{\\text{every spam email}}$$\n",
